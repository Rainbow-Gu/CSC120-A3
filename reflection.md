- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Michelle, Sam
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
OH Friday 11:00 - 12:00 & TA Sunday 19:00 - 21:00
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It seemed harder than R and Python, and it seemed more different because of the object oriented method of programming. And it seemed like we are typing many "properties" before the actual variable.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Similarities exists in many of the methods like using regex and boolean, as well as the similar format of the loops and if statements and class functions. The difference is that Java is object-oriented. It also requires one to type more syntax like `public static void main(String[] arguments)` where python achieves by a single `main()`. Java is also really picky to variables, where they were named and whether the line ends with a `;`.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think this is just trial and error, sometimes you just realize you may had forget to name something here and there and that's the reason for the mistake. Forexample, I was calling return too many times which let my response be really messy. I think just making it clear what you are doing each step, and see how the functions you wrote actually responds to what you intends to do.
